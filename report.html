Aline is a mark between two points. There are various types of lines, from
straight to squiggly to curved and more. Lines can be used for a wide
range of purposes: stressing a word or phrase, connecting content to one

another, creating patterns and much more.

COLOR

Color is used to generate
emotions, define importance,
create visual interest and more.
CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/
black) is subtractive; RGB
(red/green/blue) is additive.

Some colors are warm and
active (orange, red); some are
cool and passive (blue, purple).

There are various color types
(primary to analogous) and
relationships (monochromatic to
triad) worth learning more about
as well.

TEXTURE
Bi! =

Texture relates the to surface of an
object; the look or feel of it.
Concrete has a rough texture;
drywall has a smooth and subtle
texture. Using texture in design is a
great way to add depth and visual
interest. Printed material has actual,
textile texture while screen material
has implied texture.

Height + width = shape. We all learned basic
shapes in grade school - triangles, squares,
circles and rectangles. Odd or lesser seen
shapes can be used to attract attention.

|| A @ There are three basic types of shape:
geometric (triangles, squares, circles etc),
natural (leaves, animals, trees, people), and

 ] * t abstracted (icons, stylizations, graphic
representations etc).

Value is how light or how dark an area looks. A gradient,
shown above, is a great way to visualize value -
everything from dark to white, all the shades in-between,
has a value. Use value to create depth and light; to create
a pattern; to lead the eye; or to emphasize.

ELEMENTS
OF DESIGN

Space is the area around or
between elements in a
design. It can be used to
separate or group
information. Use it effectively
to: give the eye a rest; define
importance; lead the eye
through a design and more.

Size is how small or large something is: a small shirt
vs. an extra large shirt, for example. Use size to define
importance, create visual interest in a design (via
contrasting sizes), attract attention and more.
