# Separates-Text-and-Visual-elements-from-image
Goal: Build a program that separates text and visual elements from image.

Assignment Breakdown:
Image Analysis: The program will leverage any available Vision API to analyze the uploaded image.

Text Extraction: The program will utilize the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of the chosen API to extract all text content within the image.

Visual Element Segmentation: Basic image segmentation techniques will be implemented to potentially isolate individual visual elements present within the main image.

Deliverables:

Functional Program: A working program that achieves the core functionalities mentioned above.

Detailed Report: A well-structured report documenting your approach, the chosen technologies used, the implementation details, and any challenges encountered during development.

Bonus for Advanced Functionality:

While not required, bonus points will be awarded for the following:
Basic HTML structure to sort the extracted content into appropriate tags like paragraphs (<p>) and creating and embedding static images of visual elements using <img> tags would be an impressive extra achievement.
Out of Scope:
Complex Layouts and Designs: The program will not handle complex layouts or intricate designs within the images.
Advanced Chart Detection and Conversion: The primary focus is on text extraction. Basic chart detection can be attempted, but advanced conversion functionalities are not required.
User Interface (UI): A simple command-line interface or a basic web interface for uploading images will suffice for user interaction.
